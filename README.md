# Template for Spring Boot project using Kotlin and Crnk

This repository contains a minimal implementation for a Spring-based application that shows the 
interaction between the JVM language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and the resource-oriented 
REST library [Crnk](https://github.com/crnk-project/). It serves the purpose of extending the Crnk 
integration examples which you can find [here](https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/tree/master/crnk-integration-examples).

## Getting Started

### Requirement

Crnk requires Java 8 or later.

### Building and running the application

Building the project can be achieved by running this command in the project directory:
```
./gradlew build
```
After starting the application with 
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
the endpoints can be accessed on
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

### Integration with IntelliJ IDEA

Alternatively, after cloning this repository you can import the project into your IDE by
```
File > New > Project from Existing Sources > {Choose directory and Gradle as Build Tool}
```
