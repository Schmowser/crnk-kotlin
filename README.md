# Template for Spring Boot project using Kotlin and Crnk

This repository contains a minimal implementation for a Spring-based application that shows the 
interaction between the JVM language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and the resource-oriented 
REST library [Crnk](https://github.com/crnk-project/). It serves the purpose of extending the Crnk 
integration examples which you can find [here](https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/tree/master/crnk-integration-examples).

## Getting Started

### Requirement

Crnk requires Java 8 or later.

### Building and running the application

Building the project can be achieved by running this command in the project directory:
```
./gradlew build
```
After starting the application with 
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
the endpoints can be accessed on
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

### Integration with IntelliJ IDEA

Alternatively, after cloning this repository you can import the project into your IDE by
```
File > New > Project from Existing Sources > {Choose directory and Gradle as Build Tool}
```

## Crnk UI

Crnk offers an interface for easy managing of your Rest objects. Just fire up a browser and enter
```
http://localhost:8080/browse
```

Crnk writes all the boilerplate code for you which includes GET and POST endpoints for your objects. 
Here are some examples: Adding an ID to the Query section gives you the information on that particular 
Card object.

You can even create new instances with a ready-made POST endpoint. Hit the `Setup Post` button, enter the required fields 
and press `Post`. Note that the ID will be generated by the application. So, we use the filter in the upper-right corner 
to filter out unnecessary fields for our POST request.
